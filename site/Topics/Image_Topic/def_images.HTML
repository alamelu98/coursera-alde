 <p>An ice pop is a water or milk-based frozen snack on a stick. Unlike ice cream or sorbet, which are whipped while freezing to prevent ice crystal formation, an ice pop is "quiescently" frozen—frozen while at rest—and becomes a solid block of ice. The stick is used as a handle to hold it.</p>

 <h1>3 Rules to follow perfect image placement in the webpage</h1>
 <ul>
 	<li>
 <h2 id="resolution">The resolution of image</h2>
 <p>The resolution of the image is restricted to 72 pixels per inch ,because computer displays show images as <b>72 pixels per inch</b>.However,The image size depends upon the height and width of the image also.The Formats like <i>.jpg,.png,.gif</i> store images in the form of <q>Bitmaps</q>.</p>
 <img src="images/ppii.png" alt="Difference between 72 ppi and 300ppi" title="Difference between 72 ppi and 300ppi" width=100px height=100px>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="format">Format of the image</h2>
<p>Use the following formats depeneding upon the uses</p>
<ol>
	<li>If image is having more colours <b>use .jpeg</b>
		<dl>
			<dt><u><b>Jpeg format</b></u></dt>
			<dd>Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.JPEG have LOSSY COMPRESSION format.JPEG images don’t support TRANSPARENCY and are hence not usable for such cases.
			</dd>
			<img src="images/jjppeegg.JPEG" alt="Jpeg format" title="Jpeg format" width=100px height=100px>
		</dl>
	</li>
	<li>If image is using less colours <b>use .gif or .png </b>
		<dl>
			<dt><u><b>png format</b></u></dt>
			<dd>PNG is a LOSSLESS image format.No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image. For this reason, a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper.a great choice for images with text, logos and shapes with sharp edges.PNG images <b>support transparency</b>in two ways — inserting an <b>alpha channel</b> that allows <u>partial transparency</u> or by declaring a <u>single colour as transparent (index transparency).</u> </dd>
			<img src="images/LOGO.PNG" alt="PNG format" title="PNG format" width=100px height=100px>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><u><b>gif format</b></u></dt>
			<dd>GIF is also a lossless image format.GIF images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations.GIF images <b>support transparency by declaring a single colour </b>in the colour palette as transparent (index transparency</dd>

<h2 id="size">Right size of the image</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use correct width and height</li>
	<li>Strech the images from <i>corners</i></li>
	<li>Use Portarait or Lanscape mode</li>
